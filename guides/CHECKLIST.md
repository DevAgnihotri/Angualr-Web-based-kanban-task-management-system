curl http://localhost:3000/api/columns  # Should return JSON
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/init  # Initialize DB
npx prisma studio  # Opens GUI at port 5555
```

- [ ] Tasks are visible ← **Test this**
- [ ] Can create task ← **Test this**
- [ ] Can edit task ← **Test this**
- [ ] Can delete task ← **Test this**

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Create task → Visible in Prisma Studio ← **Test this**
- [ ] Close browser → Reopen → Task persists ← **Test this**

## 🚀 How to Verify Everything Works

### Step 1: Start Backend

```bash
npm run backend
```

✅ Should see: `🚀 Backend server running on http://localhost:3000`

### Step 2: Test API

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/columns
```

✅ Should see: JSON data

### Step 3: Initialize Database

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/init
```

✅ Should see: Success message

### Step 4: View in Prisma Studio

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

✅ Should open: http://localhost:5555 with data visible

### Step 5: Start Frontend

```bash
npm start
```

✅ Should see: App running on http://localhost:4200

### Step 6: Test in Browser

1. Open http://localhost:4200
2. Create a task
3. Close browser
4. Reopen http://localhost:4200
5. ✅ Task should still be there!
